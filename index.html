        Hello,I am currently a 2nd year undergraduate student,who is studying the electronics and communication.And this is my portfolio which I built using HTML and CSS. So I scored 92.74% in my SSLC and 88.33% in my PUC and after that I choosed to be an engineer, and as per my interest I am working and building my skills and technological knowledge day by day. I have learned HTML and CSS before,and currently working on my problem solving skills Using data structures and algorithms using C++.I know some basics of python and C language.Once I feel better with my problem solving skills then I will start with machine learning, AI and linux.
